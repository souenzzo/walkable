# Walkable Schema

As you can see in **Usage** guide, we need to provide
`sqb/compile-schema` a map describing the schema. You've got some idea
about how such a schema looks like as you glanced the example in
**Overview** section. Now let's walk through each key of the schema
map in details.

> - Backticks are used as quote marks
> - For clarity, part of the schema may not be included

## 1 :idents

Idents are the root of all queries. From an SQL dbms perspective, you
must start your graph query from somewhere, and it's a table.

### 1.1 Keyword idents

Keyword idents can be defined as simple as:

```clj
;; schema
{:idents {:people/all "person"}}
```

so queries like:

```clj
[:people/all [:person/id :person/name]]
```

will result in an SQL query like:

```sql
SELECT `id`, `name` FROM `person`
```

### 1.2 Vector idents

These are idents whose key implies some condition. Instead of
providing just the table, you provide the column (as a namespaced
keyword) whose value match the ident argument found in the ident key.

For example, the following vector ident:

```clj
;; dispatch-key: :person/by-id
;; ident arguments: 1
[:person/by-id 1]
```

will require a schema like:

```clj
;; schema
{:idents {:person/by-id :person/id}}
```

so queries like:

```clj
;; query
[[:person/by-id 1] [:person/id :person/name]]
```

will result in an SQL query like:

```sql
SELECT `id`, `name` FROM `person` WHERE `person`.`id` = 1
```

## 2 :joins

Each join schema describes the "path" from the source table (of the
source entity) to the target table (and optionally the join table).

Let's see some examples.

### Example 1: Join column living in source table

Assume table `cow` contains:

```
|----+-------|
| id | color |
|----+-------|
| 10 | white |
| 20 | brown |
|----+-------|
```

and table `farmer` has:

```
|----+------+--------|
| id | name | cow_id |
|----+------+--------|
|  1 | jon  |     10 |
|  2 | mary |     20 |
|----+------+--------|
```

and you want to get a farmer along with their cow using the query:

```clj
;; query
[{[:farmer/by-id 1] [:farmer/name {:farmer/cow [:cow/id :cow/color]}]}]
```

> For the join `:farmer/cow`, table `farmer` is the source and table
  `cow` is the target.

then you must define the join "path" like this:

```clj
;; schema
{:joins {:farmer/cow [:farmer/cow-id :cow/id]}}
```

the above join path says: start with the value of column
`farmer.cow_id` (the join column) then find the correspondent in the
column `cow.id`.

Internally, Walkable will generate this query to fetch the entity
whose ident is `[:farmer/by-id 1]`:

```sql
SELECT `farmer`.`name`, `farmer`.`cow_id` FROM `farmer` WHERE `farmer`.`id` = 1
```

the value of column `farmer`.`cow_id` will be collected (for this
example it's `10`). Walkable will then build the query for the join `:farmer/cow`:

```sql
SELECT `cow`.`id`, `cow`.`color` FROM `cow` WHERE `cow`.`id` = 10
```

Finally, Walkable will combine the results of the above SQL queries
and return the final result:

```clj
{[:farmer/by-id 1] #:farmer{:number 1,
                            :name "jon",
                            :cow #:cow{:index 10,
                                       :color "white"}}}
```

### Example 2: A join involving a join table

Assume the following tables:

source table  `person`:

```
|----+------|
| id | name |
|----+------|
|  1 | jon  |
|  2 | mary |
|----+------|
```

target table `pet`:

```
|----+--------|
| id | name   |
|----+--------|
| 10 | kitty  |
| 11 | maggie |
| 20 | ginger |
|----+--------|
```

join table `person_pet`:

```
|-----------+--------+---------------|
| person_id | pet_id | adoption_year |
|-----------+--------+---------------|
|         1 |     10 |          2010 |
|         1 |     11 |          2011 |
|         2 |     20 |          2010 |
|-----------+--------+---------------|
```

you may query for a person and their pets along with their adoption year

```clj
[{[:person/by-id 1] [:person/name {:person/pets [:pet/name :person-pet/adoption-year]}]}]
```

then the schema for the join is as simple as:

```clj
;; schema
{:joins {:person/pets [:person/id :person-pet/person-id
                       :person-pet/pet-id :pet/id]}}
```

Walkable will issue an SQL query for `[:person/by-id 1]`:

```sql
SELECT `person`.`name` FROM `person` WHERE `person`.`id` = 1
```

and another query for the join `:person/pets`:

```sql
SELECT `pet`.`name`, `person_pet`.`adoption_year`
FROM `person_pet` JOIN `pet` ON `person_pet`.`pet_id` = `pet`.`id` WHERE `person_pet`.`person_id` = 1
```

and our not-so-atonishing result:

```clj
;; result
{[:person/by-id 1] #:person{:id 1,
                            :name "jon",
                            :pets [{:pet/id 10,
                                    :pet/name "kitty"
                                    :person-pet/adoption-year 2010}
                                   {:pet/id 11,
                                    :pet/name "maggie"
                                    :person-pet/adoption-year 2011}]}}
```

### Example 3: Join column living in target table

No big deal. This is no more difficult than example 1.

Assume table `farmer` contains:

```
|----+-------|
| id | name  |
|----+-------|
| 1  | jon   |
| 2  | mary  |
|----+-------|
```

and table `cow` has:

```
|----+-------+----------|
| id | name  | owner_id |
|----+-------+----------|
| 10 | white |     1    |
| 20 | brown |     2    |
|----+-------+----------|
```

First, you need to do a `:join` from `cow` to `farmer`

Then you will be able to reverse this join.

```
{:joins          {:cow/owner [:cow/owner-id :farmer/id]}
 :reversed-joins {:farmer/cows :cow/owner}
 :cardinality    {:cow/owner :one}}
```

You may also want to add `:cardinality` to `:cow/owner` .

## 3 :reversed-joins

A handy way to avoid typing the schema for joins whose path is just
reversed version of another.

The schema for such a join is straightforward:

```clj
;; schema
{:joins          {:farmer/cow [:farmer/cow-id :cow/id]}
 :reversed-joins {:cow/owner :farmer/cow}}
```

so you can go both ways:

```clj
;; queries:

;; - find the cow of a given farmer
[{[:farmer/by-id 1] [:farmer/name {:farmer/cow [:cow/id :cow/color]}]}]

;; - find the owner of a given cow
[{[:cow/by-id 10] [:cow/id :cow/color {:cow/owner [:farmer/name]}]}]
```

Also, another reason to use `:reversed-joins` is that it helps with
semantics.

## 4 :columns

A set of available columns must be provided at compile time so
Walkable can pre-compute part of SQL query strings.

```clj
{:columns #{:farmer/name
            :cow/color}}
```

Walkable will automatically include columns found in `:joins` paths so
you don't have to.

Please note: keywords not found in the column set will be
ignored. That means if you forget to include any of them, you can't
use the missing one in a query's property or filter.

> The rationale for having a pre-defined set of columns is that your
  query resolver doesn't have to limit itself to an SQL database as a
  single source of data. If Walkable can't match a keyword to a
  column, an ident or a join, it will be passed down to the next
  plugin in the Pathom plugin chain.

On the other hand, you don't have to include every single column in
your database if you know you will never use some of them in a query's
property or filter.

## 5 :cardinality

Idents and joins can have cardinality of either `:many` (which is
default) or `:one`. You declare that by their dispatch keys:

```clj
;; schema
{:cardinality {:person/by-id :one
               ;; you can skip all `:many`!
               :people/all   :many}}
```

## 6 :extra-conditions

Please see documentation for [Filters](/doc/filters.md)

## 7 :quote-marks

Different SQL databases use different strings to denote quotation. For
instance, MySQL use a pair of backticks:

```sql
SELECT * FROM `table`
```

while PostgreSQL use quotation marks:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "table"
```

You need to provide the quote-marks as a vector of two strings

```clj
;; schema for mysql
{:quote-marks ["`", "`"]}
```

or
```clj
;; schema for postgres
{:quote-marks ["\"", "\""]}
```

For convenience, you can use the predefined vars instead:

```clj
;; schema for mysql
{:quote-marks sqb/backticks}
;; or postgresql
{:quote-marks sqb/quotation-marks}
```

The default quote-marks are the backticks, which work for mysql and
sqlite.

## 8 :sqlite-union

Set it to `true` if you're using SQLite, otherwise ignore
it. Basically SQLite don't allow to union queries directly.
With other SQL DBMS, the union query can be something like:

```sql
SELECT a, b FROM foo WHERE ...
UNION ALL
SELECT a, b FROM foo WHERE ...
```

SQLite will raise a syntax error exception for such queries. Instead,
a valid query for SQLite must be something like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM (SELECT a, b FROM foo WHERE ...)
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM (SELECT a, b FROM foo WHERE ...)
```

`{:sqlite-union true}` is for enforcing just that.

## 9 :required-columns (Experimental - Subject to change)

> You need to understand Pathom plugins to make use of this.

Automatically fetch some columns of the same level whenever a
namespace keyword is asked for. This is useful when you want to derive
a property from some SQL columns using Clojure code (to be specific,
as Pathom plugins)

Please see [example.clj](/dev/src/walkable_demo/handler/example.clj)
for examples. Things to look at:

- `derive-attributes` which calculates `:pet/age` and `:person/age`
 from `:pet/yob` and `:person/yob` respectively.

- required inputs for `:pet/age` and `:person/age` in
  `:required-columns` schema:

```clj
;; schema
{:required-columns {:pet/age    #{:pet/yob}
                    :person/age #{:person/yob}}}
```

## 10 :pseudo-columns (Experimental - Subject to change)

Please see [dev.clj](/dev/src/dev.clj) for examples.
